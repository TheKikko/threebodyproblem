# Three-body problem simulator

Nothing unique, just wanted to make my own. 

Currently does n-body simulation (preset 3 bodies, change nBodies to whatever you want). 

## TODO 
- refactor to make it more understandable; the code works now but it's not readable
- if two bodies get too far away, stop; maybe if sum(f) < some tolerance? Or just too far away? 
- prettier colors? Anything else to make it look better?
